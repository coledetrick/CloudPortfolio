The goal for these scripts was to write a script that can analyse basic server performance stats.
The stats measured in my script are the following:
- Total CPU usage.
- Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage).
- Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage).
- Top 5 processes by CPU usage.
- Top 5 processes by memory usage.

- This task got me more familiar with BASH, I'm more familiar with Python and was surprised by how much you can do with so little with BASH.
