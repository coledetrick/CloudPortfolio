The goal of this script was to write a simple tool to analyze logs from the command line, specifically nginx logs to grab whatever information you want.
The data my script looks for is as follows:

**Top 5 IP addresses with the most requests** 
**Top 5 most requested paths** 
**Top 5 response status codes** 
**Top 5 user agents**
